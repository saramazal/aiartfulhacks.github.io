## Skills Assessment
To complete this skills assessment, you will need to apply various techniques learned in this module, including:

- Using whois
- Analyzing robots.txt
- Performing subdomain brute-forcing
- Crawling and analyzing results
- Demonstrate your proficiency by effectively utilizing these techniques. Remember to add subdomains to your hosts file as you discover them.

## Question 5: What is the API key the inlanefreight.htb developers will be changing to?

#### vHosts needed for these questions: inlanefreight.htb

## Answer:

## Step 1: Add TARGET_IP and vhost to hosts:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
<TARGET_IP>   inlanefreight.htb
```
## Step 2: Find subdomains with gobuster:

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:$PORT -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
```
## Step 3: Add new domain to hosts:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
<TARGET_IP>  web1337.inlanefreight.htb
```

## Step 4: Use gobuster with new subdomain and add result to hosts:

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://web1337.inlanefreight.htb:$PORT -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
```
## Result:
```bash
Found: dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:PORT Status: 200
```
## Step 5: Install scrapy and ReconSpider:

```bash
pip3 install scrapy

wget -O ReconSpider.zip https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/144/ReconSpider.v1.2.zip

unzip ReconSpider.zip

python3 ReconSpider.py http://dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:$PORT 
```

## Step 6: Analyze the results:

```bash 
cat results.json
```
### Extracted Comments:
